4. Methods 'head/tail' added for objects SpatialPointsTopography and SpatialPointsMeteorology
5. Bug correction: Historical download of AEMET data returns SunshineHours

6. Bug correction: Missing values in downloadAEMEThistorical

_Version 0.7.3, June 2018.
1. New function 'meteocomplete'.
2. Improvement of function 'meteoplot' to accept data frames with daily meteorological data as input

_Version 0.7.2, March 2018.
1. Update of functions to download data from AEMET to deal with encoding
2. Update of function 'SpatialPointsMeteorology' to build objects from sets of data frames, one per date
3. Update of function 'MeteorologyInterpolationData' to build objects from different data structures
4. New function 'summaryinterpolationdata' to summarize objects of class 'MeteorologyInterpolationData'

_Version 0.7.1, March 2018.

2. Bug correction in correctionpoints.errors (with rds input)

_Version 0.7.0, February 2018.
1. New S4 structures: SpatialPixelsTopography and SpatialPixelsMeteorology
2. New function interpolationpixels
3. Update of functions to download data from the Spanish Agencia Estatal de Meteorologia (AEMET)
4. New function writemeteorologypixels
5. Function correctiongrid removed (correction of weather series makes sense for point data)
6. New function summarypixels

_Version 0.6.9, December 2017.
1. Allow saturated (> 100% values) in relative humidity when extracting from NetCDF and when performing bias correction

_Version 0.6.8, November 2017.

1. Modification of the precipitation interpolation (kernels)
2. Modification of radiation calculation (diffuse light for slopes where direct light is too low)
3. Modification of partitioning between direct and diffuse radiation

_Version 0.6.7, November 2017.

1. Improvements in 'subsample' function
2. New function 'radiation_skyLongwaveRadiation'

1. Export format txt/rds
2. Changed description

_Version 0.6.5, October 2017.

1. Default correction method for wind switched to 'quantmap'.
2. Unbias method for Tmin and Tmax applies bias from Tmean (if also unbiasing).
3. Quantile mapping method for Tmin and Tmax is applied to (Tmin-Tmean) and (Tmax-Tmean).

_Version 0.6.4, September 2017.

1. Corrected a bug in the correction of relative humidity.
2. New function 'correctionpoints.errors' to evaluate correction errors for the reference period.
