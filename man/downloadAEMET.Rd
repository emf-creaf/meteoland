Download data from AEMET
}
\description{
DEPRECATED. Download data from the Spanish National Meterology Agency (AEMET)
}
\usage{
downloadAEMETstationlist(api)
downloadAEMEThistorical(api, dates, station_id = NULL, export = FALSE, 
                    exportDir = getwd(), exportFormat = "meteoland/txt", 
                    metadataFile = "MP.txt", verbose = TRUE)
downloadAEMETcurrentday(api, daily = TRUE, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{api}{String with the AEMET API key (see https://opendata.aemet.es/).}
  \item{dates}{An object of class \code{\link{Date}}.}
  \item{station_id}{A string vector containing station ids (the list of stations for which historical climatic series are available is given by \code{downloadAEMETstationlist}).}
  \item{export}{If \code{export = FALSE} the downloaded data is stored in memory. Otherwise the result is written on the disk (using the format specified in \code{exportFormat}).}
  \item{exportDir}{Output directory for downloaded meteorology.}
  \item{exportFormat}{Format of meteorological data. Current accepted formats are \code{"castanea"} and \code{"meteoland"}.}
  \item{metadataFile}{The name of the file that will store the meta data describing all written files.}
  \item{verbose}{Boolean flag to print process information.}
  \item{daily}{Boolean flag. Are data to be returned at a daily or hourly scale?}
}
\details{
API key needs to be acquired from AEMET (https://opendata.aemet.es/)
}
\value{
Function \code{downloadAEMETstationlist} returns a \code{\link{SpatialPointsDataFrame-class}} object containing the list of AEMET weather stations for which historical climatic series are available and can be retrieved using \code{downloadAEMEThistorical}. 

Function \code{downloadAEMEThistorical} downloads data for the specified AEMET stations and dates. Data are availables for dates up to 4 days before current date. If \code{export = FALSE}, function \code{downloadAEMEThistorical} returns a \code{\link{SpatialPointsMeteorology-class}} object with the downloaded meteorology for each station (point). Otherwise the function writes on the disk at the location specified by \code{exportDir} and solelely returns a \code{\link{SpatialPointsDataFrame-class}} object containing the files metadata. 

Function \code{downloadAEMETcurrentday} downloads recent weather (the last 24h) from all currently available stations and returns data frame if \code{daily = FALSE} or a \code{\link{SpatialPointsDataFrame-class}} object with observations aggregated at the daily scale if else. 
}
\note{
Recommended package: \code{meteospain}.

The list of stations available in \code{downloadAEMETcurrentday} (current observations) may be different from the list given by \code{downloadAEMETstationlist} and available in \code{downloadAEMEThistorical} (stations with historical climate series).
