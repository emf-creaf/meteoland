\usage{
extractNetCDF(
  ncdf_files,
  bbox = NULL,
  offset = 0,
  cells = NULL,
  export = TRUE,
  exportDir = getwd(),
  exportFormat = "meteoland/txt",
  mpfilename = "MP.txt"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ncdf_files}{Character vector containing files to read}

\item{bbox}{Boundary box (2 x 2 matrix) specifying the limit coordinates of
a study area (in lon/lat format).}

\item{offset}{A buffer to include NetCDF cells that are at a certain
distance around the boundary box.}

\item{cells}{A (n x 2) matrix specifying the x and y indices of n cells in a
grid.}

\item{export}{If \code{export = FALSE} the extracted data is stored in
memory. Otherwise the result is written in the disk (using the format
specified in \code{exportFormat}).}

\item{exportDir}{Output directory for extracted meteorology.}

\item{exportFormat}{Export format for meteorological data (see
\code{\link{writemeteorologypoint}}).}

\item{mpfilename}{The name of the file that will store the meta data
describing all written files.}
}
\value{
If \code{export = FALSE}, the function returns an object of class
\code{\link{SpatialPointsMeteorology-class}} with the meteorological series
for each cell (represented by a spatial point). Otherwise the function
returns an object of class \code{\link{SpatialPointsDataFrame-class}}
containing the meta data of the files written in the disk.

This function reads a set of NetCDF files (one per variable) and extracts
data for a set of NetCDF cells that are specified using a boundary box (in
lon/lat format) or a set of (x,y) grid indices.
}
\details{
Function \code{extractNetCDF} first identifies which cells in NetCDF data
should be extracted according to \code{bbox} (or the cells are indicated by
the user using \code{cells}), and the overall period (days). If neither
\code{bbox} or \code{cells} is supplied, then all NetCDF cells will be
processed. For each cell to be processed, the function loops over all files
(which can describe different variables and time periods) and extracts the
corresponding data. The function transforms units to the units used in
\code{meteoland}. If specific humidity and mean temperature are available,
the function calculates mean relative humidity.

Extracted meteorological data (a data frame with days in rows and
meteorological variables in columns) can be stored in an object
\code{\link{SpatialPointsMeteorology-class}} or it can be written in the
disk (one file per cell). In the latter case, the output format can be
chosen and the function also writes a supplementary file containing the meta
data (i.e. the coordinates and filename of each file).

Humidity in climate model files is given as specific humidity. This is
converted to relative humidity and the conversion may produce values above
saturation (>100\%) (see also \code{\link{defaultCorrectionParams}} for the
same issue when performing bias correction).
