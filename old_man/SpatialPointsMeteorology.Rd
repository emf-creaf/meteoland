\description{
Initializes an object of class \code{SpatialPointsMeteorology-class}
}
\usage{
SpatialPointsMeteorology(points, data, dates, dataByDate = FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{points}{An object of class \code{\link{SpatialPoints-class}}. Row names of point coordinates are used to identify points.}
  \item{data}{A list of data frames. If \code{dataByDate = FALSE} the elements of \code{data} are assumed to correspond to points. If \code{dataByDate = TRUE} the elements of \code{data} are assumed to correspond to dates (see 'Details').}
  \item{dates}{Object of class \code{"Date"} describing the time period of meteorological estimates.}
  \item{dataByDate}{A flag to indicate that elements of \code{data} correspond to dates, as opposed to the default (\code{dataByDate = FALSE}) which assumes that elements correspond to points (see 'Details').}
}
\details{
 There are two ways of building an object of of class \code{\link{SpatialPointsMeteorology-class}}. The first way (\code{dataByDate = FALSE}) is to supply as value for \code{data} a vector of data frames with one data frame per spatial point, with dates as rows and meteorological variables as columns. In this case all data frames must have the same number of rows (dates) and columns (variables). The second way (if \code{dataByDate = TRUE}) is to supply as value for \code{data} a vector of data frames with one data frame per date, with points as rows and meteorological variables as columns. In this case, the data frames may have different rows and different columns. Only the information corresponding to \code{points} will be taken and some variables may be missing.
